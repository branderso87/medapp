ScriptLoop was created during Angelhack Austin 2017. It attempts to close the gap in the doctor, patient, medication chain by giving patients the tools they need to manage and track their healthcare. Patients have the ability to connect with prescription management services like Express Scripts to order medication and have it delivered right to their door. And doctors can now approve prescription refills and give prior authorization through our Doctor Dashboard, allowing Express Scripts and services like it, to fulfill orders faster than ever.

The ScriptLoop app and Alexa skill were built using Javascript, MongoDB, & IBM's LoopBack.
